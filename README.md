# Hi there! 👋
I’m Caleb, a backend-focused full-stack developer based in Kenya.  
I enjoy building reliable, efficient and maintainable backend systems while still being able to connect them to clean, functional frontends.

These days I’m focused on:

- Node.js, Java, Spring Boot, Go
- REST APIs, database design and server architecture
- Writing CLI tools and automation scripts
- Building small, thoughtful projects with practical use

Some stuff I built:

- **[JarRun](https://github.com/Caleb-ne1/JarRun)** – A CLI tool to run, restart, and monitor Java applications with logs.  
- **[svault-go](https://github.com/Caleb-ne1/svault-go)** – A secure, encrypted command-line secret manager written in Go.  
- **[recipe-finder-API](https://github.com/Caleb-ne1/recipe-finder-API)** – A REST API for searching recipes and managing favorites.  
- **[gmail_sending_api](https://github.com/Caleb-ne1/gmail_sending_api)** – A Node.js backend service for sending emails programmatically.  
- **[cipher-ui](https://github.com/Caleb-ne1/cipher-ui)** – An interactive web app simulating the Enigma cipher machine.  
- **[image-uploader](https://github.com/Caleb-ne1/image-uploader)** – A full-stack app for uploading and managing images (React + Node.js + MinIO).  
- **[proxmox-lxc-postgresql-installer](https://github.com/Caleb-ne1/proxmox-lxc-postgresql-installer)** – A script to automate PostgreSQL setup in Proxmox containers.
